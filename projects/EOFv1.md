# EOFv1

Over the last couple weeks I spent time learning about the upcoming changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In order to lessen computational overhead, prevent abnormal state, and boost performance, a series of EOF EIPs was introduced. 

# Description / Motivation

My foremost reasoning for tackling the EIPs is such that I work with the EVM as an execution environment most frequently, thus I believe it is most beneficial to take up this post because my past experience will translate best. EOFv1 brings a handful of changes to the instruction set, runtime checks, and stack validation. These proposed changes will increase the performance of the protocol and help eliminate quirks that make iteration more difficult by performing validation checks at contract runtime.

# Roadmap

WIP

Seek clarification on open specs and suggest implementation details. 

Engage with the people working on EOFv1.

Create implementations to the best of my ability based on spec. 

# Goal

The goal of this project is to collaborate on improvements to the core infrastructure of Ethereum and fostering a deeper undestanding of the wider protocol. Ethereum is the only reason why I can write code today, so I am grateful to be in a position where I can help further the state of R&D. I believe I will come out of this a stronger developer with a much better understanding of the underlying implementation details of Ethereum.
