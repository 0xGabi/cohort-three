# How to Participate in EPF

## Dive In

Visit the [reading list](./reading.md) and get started immersing yourself in the various Ethereum protocol topics. Create PR’s to add additional reading that you found interesting or relevant.

## Choose a project

Mentors have [suggested various projects](/projects/project-ideas.md) that you can work on but you are encouraged to work on a project that you feel interested in or inspired by. Choose a project that you would like to work on during the duration of the program. Your project does not need to be completed at the end of the program but you are expected to make progress during the four months of the program.

## Participate in the discussion

Join the Ethereum R&D Discord. Use the *#protocol-fellowship* channel for general discussion but use the appropriate channels for conversations regarding specific topics, especially if you are seeking assistance or feedback from a mentor. Please keep this discussion relevant to what you are working on. Our intention is to keep these channels open, but if there is a lot of noise, restrictions may be added.

## Make weekly updates

Weekly updates help us to see how you are progressing in your project. Making an update each week will not only keep you accountable to your project, but it will also track your ability to do the work. Remember that our goal is to help you find placement with a client team, research team, or help you to become a funded independent contributor.

*How to make weekly updates*
- Follow the guidelines in the [Repo Guide](./repo-guide.md)
- Post your update or a link to your update in the [Development Updates](/development-updates.md)
- Link your update in the weekly update thread in *#protocol-fellowship*

## Get help from Mentors

The EPF has a pool of [mentors](./mentors.md) that are here to assist your process. They can unlock roadblocks that you are having, give feedback on your progress, or help point you in the right direction if you are stuck. Mentors are NOT here to teach you how to do things, tell you what to do or hold you accountable to your project. Please be respectful of mentors’ time. Try to figure it out on your own first. If asking for help is necessary, be concise and direct.

*How to interact with mentors*
- Ask a question in the #protocol-fellowship channel and tag them.
- Ask a specific question about the topic you are working on in the appropriate channel
- If an ongoing conversation is necessary, ask the mentor for a DM
- Add a comment in the [Office Hours](.../issues) issue in the GitHib repo for the upcoming meeting outlining the problem you are having or the discussion you would like to happen

## Join weekly meetings

There will be 2 meetings every week. One will be a weekly stand-up meeting, where you can discuss your progress with other participants. The second is the Office Hours meeting, where mentors will be present to discuss the topics that have been raised in the GitHub issue for that week. Both of these meetings are open to all participants.
