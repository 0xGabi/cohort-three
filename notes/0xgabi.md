# Gabi's Notes

Hi I'm Gabi, or 0xGabi on [Github](https://github.com/0xGabi). I been working on the DAO space for the last 4 years doing smart contracts, testing, backend and front-end work. I'm interested on contributing to EIP-4844.

## Updates

#### 25/18/2022
- I started a Notion page to organize study materials: [Fellowship](https://0xgabi.notion.site/Fellowship-0b629dbc572f499db254d40ea481e099)
- I participated on the last couple breakout calls and today's 4844 implementers' call
- Last few weeks I contributed with a couple of tools that were needed for 4844:
    - faucet: https://eip4844-faucet.vercel.app/
    - blobs explorer: https://www.blobscan.com/
- I published a docker image with a blob-indexer that we use on blobscan:
    - repo: [blob-indexer](https://github.com/BlossomLabs/blob-indexer)
    - docker image: [blossomlabs/blob-indexer](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/blossomlabs/blob-indexer)

## Plans

#### Week #1
- Get up to speed with the latest spec changes of EIP-4844: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/647.
- Get up to speed with the 4844 tracking on Lighthouse: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3625.
- Help with new 4844 devnet as needed to support both faucet and blobs explorer.
