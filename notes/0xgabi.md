# Gabi's Notes

Hi I'm Gabi, or 0xGabi on [Github](https://github.com/0xGabi). I been working on the DAO space for the last 4 years doing smart contracts, testing, backend and front-end work. I'm interested on contributing to EIP-4844.

## Updates

#### 10/25/2022
- I started a Notion page to organize study materials: [Fellowship](https://0xgabi.notion.site/Fellowship-0b629dbc572f499db254d40ea481e099)
- I participated on the last couple breakout calls and today's 4844 implementers' call
- Last few weeks I contributed with a couple of tools that were needed for 4844:
    - faucet: https://eip4844-faucet.vercel.app/
    - blobs explorer: https://www.blobscan.com/
- I published a docker image with a blob-indexer that we use on blobscan:
    - repo: [blob-indexer](https://github.com/BlossomLabs/blob-indexer)
    - docker image: [blossomlabs/blob-indexer](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/blossomlabs/blob-indexer)

#### 10/31/2022
- I meet Jimmy other fellowship memeber and we started a shared effort on 4844 front. We contacted with Lighthouse mentors and schedule a kick-off call. 
- I create a plan to [study Rust](https://0xgabi.notion.site/Rust-d5145f4840f1429481f74433871a2193).
- I continue learning about ETH 2.0 with [Ben's book](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/incentives/diversity).
- I did a deep dive on the p2p networking. Learn more about libp2p:
    - [Introduction](https://docs.libp2p.io/introduction/)
    - [Publish subscribe](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/publish-subscribe/)
    - [DHT](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dht/)
    - [phase0 p2p interface](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md)

#### 11/07/2022
- I particiapte of the mentor's kick-off with Lighthouse team. We discussed the project and the next steps. [Action items document](https://hackmd.io/BjROTQriTEq_VF6Wz9Zebw).
- I finished the core concept of the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and most of [rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
- I setup my dev environment and local testnet on the Lighthouse codebase.

## Plans

#### Week #1
- Get up to speed with the latest spec changes of EIP-4844: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/647.
- Get up to speed with the 4844 tracking on Lighthouse: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3625.
- Help with new 4844 devnet as needed to support both faucet and blobs explorer.

#### Week #2
- I got the fundamentals of Rust lenguage following my [study plan](https://0xgabi.notion.site/Rust-d5145f4840f1429481f74433871a2193).
- I will particate on 4844 implementers' call. And keep up to date with latest 4844 spec.
