# EagleEdge's Notes
## Introduction
Hello, this is Eagle Edge (pseudo name), a R&D researcher on public blockchain. 
Drawing on tools from optimization, game theory, econometrics, mathematical modeling, and statistics, I aim to research on Ethereum 
and layer 2 roll up economic models. I have been working on the dynamic interplay between Ethereum and Ethereum rollups 
in terms of transaction fees and demand. 

## Updates
[10/18/2022]
- Created my very first update ([Update #1](https://hackmd.io/kEPaNWa3QliqEK9SZ2vCBA)) with what I am excited about. 
- Added my update to the [development-updates.md](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/development-updates.md).

[10/19/2022]
- Wrote a [summary report](https://hackmd.io/@EagleEdge/ryTtmFgEj) after reading the article [Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574.pdf).
- Skimmed the article [Transaction Fee Mechanism Design for the Ethereum Blockchain: An Economic Analysis of EIP-1559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00854). I will read it again thoroughly next.
- Enrolled cadCAD Bootcamp (Beginner Level) as a prerequiste for cadCAD masterclass in Ethereum economic model.
## Plans for the Short- and Medium-Term (One Month)

### Plans for 21/10/2022 and weekend
- Finish reading [Understanding rollup economics from first principles](https://barnabe.substack.com/p/understanding-rollup-economics-from).
- Read and understand [Transaction Fee Mechanism Design for Ethereum Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00854.pdf)

### Plans for the week of October 24-28 (full time)
- Enroll and finish [cadCAD Masterclass: Ethereum Validator Economics](https://www.cadcad.education/course/masterclass-ethereum)

### Plans for the weeks beyond the week of October 24-28
- Review Ethereum economic model [Github repo](https://github.com/CADLabs/ethereum-economic-model)
