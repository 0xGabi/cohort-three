# EagleEdge's Notes
## Introduction
Hello, this is Eagle Edge (pseudo name), a R&D researcher on public blockchain. 
Drawing on tools from optimization, game theory, econometrics, mathematical modeling, and statistics, I aim to research on Ethereum 
and layer 2 roll up economic models. I have been working on the dynamic interplay between Ethereum and Ethereum rollups 
in terms of transaction fees and demand. 

## Updates
[10/18/2022]
- Created my very first update ([Update #1](https://hackmd.io/kEPaNWa3QliqEK9SZ2vCBA)) with what I am excited about. 
- Added my update to the [development-updates.md](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/development-updates.md).

## Plans for the Short- and Medium-Term (One Month)
