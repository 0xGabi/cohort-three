# Jayesh Bhole's notes

Hey folks, this is [Jayesh Bhole](https://github.com/jayeshbhole), an undergrad student at IIIT Pune and a web3 builder. I've been working with EVM compatible web3 projects/ideas for almost a year and half through various hackathons and projects.

## What I am interested in?

By nature, I am a generalist and it's difficult for me to have very specific inclinations. I am a relentless builder though, so I am always trying to figure out the next task at hand.

In this cohort, I am interested in working on the UX and frontend of the 4337 Wallet proposed by Garvit Khatri. I have always liked creating good user experiences and I hope I can contribute to this project in that regard.

## Notes

Below are the notes & links that I will be collecting during my research, the date format is [dd.mm.yy]


### [13.11.22] Getting started with the UX design

<summary>...Read More</summary>
I have started working on the UX research and design of the wallet.

I am considering the following points while designing the UX:
- The wallet onboarding should be as abstracted (pun intended) as possible. The user should not have to worry about the underlying implementation of the wallet.
- The UI should be similar to those of web2 wallets and trad-fi applications so that new users getting into the ecosystem can easily understand the flow. There should be a balance between the familiarity of the UI and the newness of the technology.
- The wallet should be able to handle multiple accounts and should be able to switch between them easily.
- The transaction history and data should be presented in a more understandable way. 
- Ways to declare and add paymasters should be provided to the user.
- The designs should reflect trust and security that the EIP-4337 proposes.
