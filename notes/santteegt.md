# Santiago's notes

## Introduction

I'm a full-stack web3 dev & data engineer. Been in the ethereum space since 2018 mostly as a dApp developer. For this cohort is a bit more general in terms of how start gettting involved & contribute to the core protocol. In the coming weeks I'll start focusing on a specific project that I could end up contributing to.
