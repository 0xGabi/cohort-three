Wesley, based in Amsterdam and currently part of EF Devcon team. Very excited to be here with you all and dive deeper into Ethereum & protocol development. 

## Introduction

My primary interest for joining the program is to explore how we can improve (base-layer) privacy and other solutions that add more privacy by default.
 
With all the recent events, I very much agree with @Tim that our window to add good privacy solutions is closing.. We need to act now!

Another interesting tweet by Balaji on how do we keep the versatility of Ethereum with the privacy of Zcash?

Other objectives:
1. Make a meaningful contribution to one of the client projects (e.g. Lodestar)
1. On-board more core devs, using my own experience by documenting my experiences and learnings @ [useWeb3](https://www.useweb3.xyz/)
1. Collaborate with the Privacy & Scaling Exploration (PSE) team to move beyond exploration. 

### Updates
