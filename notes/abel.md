# Abel's notes
## Introduction
I'm a physicist, working on a PhD in genetics, and my excitement about formal treatments of complex systems has led me to Ethereum.

## Updates
### [2022.10.18] Initial note
This is mostly a placeholder for now. Further development updates will be available here. Initial idea: discuss the usage of the Open Game engine (https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-games-hs) with Barnabe Monnot. A demo is presented from 3:51 on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v3Fj1GQ0aPI

**Relevant background material**:
- [Bayesian Open Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656), 
- [Composing games into complex institutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05318.pdf)
- [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
- There seem to be some examples based on staking [here](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/tree/master/src/Examples/Staking), but I do not really know what they implement.
