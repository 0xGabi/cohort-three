# Abel's notes
## Introduction
I'm a physicist, working on a PhD in genetics, and my excitement about formal treatments of complex systems has led me to Ethereum.

## Updates

### [2022.10.20] First meeting
- Had first discussion with Barnab√©
- More precise plan: What do MEV strategies look like in the open games framework, and how do they interact. That is: given an open game description of a contract, how should we think about the strategies of the users and block builders. I could start with a simple toy system and see where that leads us.

**Challenges**
- How to go from smart contract to open game? The *Clockwork Finance* framework seems like a nice approach:
    - Background paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04347.pdf
    - Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/kushalbabel/status/1438511507508137987
    - Lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n52xBSk2TSs
    - Discussion (from 26:35): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3GOGesPKlw
    - This uses the *K*-framework. 
        - Very long introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQMi_N42B8
        - very short introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSaIKHQOo4c
- Who are the players in this game? 
    - Users: send transactions that can lead to MEV opportunities
    - Builders: Have the power to extract MEV
    - Contracts: also have 'strategies'--can respond to states and contexts
    - The MEV calculator/searcher? Or should I assume the existence of an MEV oracle?
- What do MEV strategies actually look like in practice? 
- Install Haskell and the Open Game engine



### [2022.10.18] Initial note
This is mostly a placeholder for now. Further development updates will be available here. Initial idea: discuss the usage of the Open Game engine (https://github.com/jules-hedges/open-games-hs) with Barnabe Monnot. A demo is presented from 3:51 on here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v3Fj1GQ0aPI

**Relevant background material**:
- [Bayesian Open Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656), 
- [Composing games into complex institutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05318.pdf)
- [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
- There seem to be some examples based on staking [here](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs/tree/master/src/Examples/Staking), but I do not really know what they implement.
